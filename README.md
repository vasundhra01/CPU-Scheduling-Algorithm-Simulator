# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A web-based simulator that visualizes and compares classic CPU scheduling algorithms.  
This project is designed to help students understand how different scheduling strategies affect waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

---

## 📌 Features

- Interactive simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms
- Supports multiple processes with arrival and burst times
- Visual timeline (Gantt chart) representation
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Average metrics for comparison
- Clean and responsive UI built with modern web tools

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (with configurable time quantum)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Node.js**
